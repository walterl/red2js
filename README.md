# red2js

Convert [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) flow data to JavaScript pseudo code.

**Generated code is NOT executable!** red2js output is intended to aid in
understanding complex Node-RED flows, not to generate drop-in replacements for
Node-RED.

## Limitations

The generated JavaScript is incomplete in a number of ways, including:

- Only converts function nodes' _On Message_ functionality.
- Many node types' conversion does not model all functionality support by the
  node type. See the implementation of `rbe` nodes, as an example.
- It doesn't handle [multiple outputs](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/writing-functions#multiple-outputs)/`node.send()`.

There are likely other, significant ways in which generated code is incomplete,
or even incorrect.

## Usage

Specify the Node-RED `flows.json` file to red2js, and get the JavaScript pseudo code on stdout:

    $ clj -M:run-m flows.json

Run the project's CI pipeline and build an uberjar:

    $ clj -T:build ci

Run that uberjar:

    $ java -jar target/red2js-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
